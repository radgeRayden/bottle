Every game programmer eventually has the urge to create their own game engine. This is mine. It's written in Scopes, an experimental programming language. Learn more about it here: http://scopes.rocks/

Basic goals (for a first version):
- Good enough for sprite based games
- C API for use with different languages
- can be combined with game code in a standalone executable (+ supporting shared libraries)

I will add more details once I'm bothered enough to do so.
